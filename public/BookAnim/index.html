        <h2>JS at its minimum</h2>
        <p>JavaScript is at its minimum. Basically it's only used to set the initial
          page index and assign click listeners to the pages. Modifies the CSS <b>Var</b>
          for the <i>current</i> page, and the rest is handled entirely by CSS.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="back">
        <p>Additionally JavaScript allows you to click on an anchor link in your
          text — without turning the page. You can also have multiple independent
          flip books in a single document. You're all covered.</p>

        <h2>Crafting CSS magic</h2>
        <p>The opened (<i>viewing</i>) pages of the flip book are always kept at the same elevation.
          This is necessary if your book has no inclination (is top-down-view).
          Have you noticed that you can also click on the pages edge? CSS will nicely animate the group
          of pages to skip with a staggered animation.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="back">
        <p>Like in this demo, you can change the perspective of the parent container and change the
          X axis rotation of the book for extra effect.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="page">
      <div class="front">
        <p>The necessary FlipBook's CSS is barely 30 lines, there is no swipe, natural page flip angling,
          complex shadows, etc. in order to keep it as simple as possible.</p>
